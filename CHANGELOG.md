# Changelog

Kineto follows Semantic Versioning. Public scope is additionally governed by `FEATURE_CONTRACT.md`.

## [0.8.22]

- **Demo deploy — back to @latest + purge script**: the site loads the library from `@latest` again; run `npm run purge` after publishing to flush the jsDelivr cache so the newest build shows immediately.

## [0.8.21]

- **Demo deploy — pin exact version (fixes stale fixes)**: the generated site now loads the library from `@<version>` instead of `@latest`. jsDelivr caches `@latest` for hours/days, so published library fixes (wipe, slider loop, counter…) kept serving an old bundle on the demo. Pinning the immutable exact version loads each release fresh, no purge needed.

## [0.8.20]

- **Fix — progress ring off-center (root cause)**: a mobile `@media` rule lifted *every* `.kt-progress-ring` with `bottom:calc(...)!important`, shoving the in-card static ring up ~78px. Scoped it to `body>.kt-progress-ring` so only the floating corner ring is lifted; the demo ring now centers.

## [0.8.19]

- **Demo — progress ring centered (absolute fill)**: the ring container now absolutely fills its stage and grid-centers, independent of any flex/grid height quirks, so the indicator is dead-center on mobile.

## [0.8.18]

- **Fix — horizontal pinned deck clipped**: the horizontal sticky-stack deck used `vh` for its height, so on mobile the bottom of a panel was clipped while scrolling down (URL bar showing). It now uses `svh` so panels always fit.
- **Fix — mobile pinned-scroll bounce**: ScrollTrigger no longer refreshes on the mobile URL-bar show/hide resize (`ignoreMobileResize`), so sticky-stack / scroll-sequence sections stop jumping the page down to the footer.
- **Demo — progress ring centered (for real)**: the ring stage now flex-centers, fixing the indicator being clipped at the top on mobile.

## [0.8.17]

- **Demo — progress ring truly centered**: the ring stage now fills its cell and grid-centers the indicator, so it sits dead-center vertically on mobile instead of drifting up.

## [0.8.16]

- **Demo — first-screen snap only after content is seen**: the hero→first-section snap now waits until the hero is fully scrolled into view, so a hero taller than the viewport (low-res / small window) reveals its cut-off content by normal scroll before snapping instead of jumping straight past it.
- **Demo — iOS motion button removed**: the built-in permission gate grants DeviceOrientation on the first genuine tap, so tilt + compass work without the extra button.

## [0.8.15]

- **Demo — Fullpage inner-scroll shown**: the "Fullpage Sections" demo now has a long section (02) that scrolls its own content before paging to the next, demonstrating the inner-scroll-then-advance behavior added in 0.8.13.

## [0.8.14]

- **Wipe/mask — actually animates now**: the real cause was that the bundled gsap won't tween a `clip-path: inset()` string (it stayed frozen fully-clipped = blank). Wipe/mask now run on a numeric proxy tween and build the inset string in onUpdate, so the reveal always plays (via ScrollTrigger or the IntersectionObserver backup) and on replay.
- **Lazy replay on Safari/iOS**: `preload` now resolves immediately for an already-cached image (Safari doesn't re-fire `onload` for a cached src), so BlurUp/Fade replay no longer hangs.
- **Demo — mobile notice keeps the border**: the touch “desktop only” overlay redraws the stage's 1px border so cards don't look broken.
- **Demo — progress ring centered**: the ring stage uses explicit flex centering so the indicator sits dead-center on mobile.
- **Demo — motion button placement**: the iOS “모션 센서 켜기” button sits above the bottom bar and fades out over the footer so it never overlaps it (still auto-dismisses after granting).

## [0.8.13]

- **Reveal — reliable entrance (fixes stuck Wipe)**: an IntersectionObserver backup now guarantees a reveal plays when it actually enters the viewport, even if ScrollTrigger measured its position before images/intro settled or the element was already on screen. Wipe no longer stays blank.
- **Slider — two loop styles**: `loop:'infinite'` (or `true`) endlessly wraps seamlessly; `loop:'rewind'` plays to the last slide then returns to the first; `loop:'off'` disables.
- **Counter (split-flap) — up & down**: the flip counter supports decreasing values (folds up) as well as increasing (folds down), following `from`→`to`.
- **Lazy skeleton/pulse — no icon ghost**: the pulse opacity keyframe is stopped before the fade-out, so the skeleton + icon disappear cleanly instead of lingering over the loaded image.
- **Fullpage — auto-advance + inner scroll**: new `autoAdvance` (ms) steps sections on a timer (pauses when hidden, resets on manual nav); a section taller than the viewport scrolls its own content before the deck pages on.
- **iOS — motion enable button** and **mobile demo polish**: a visible “모션 센서 켜기” button guarantees a valid tap to grant DeviceOrientation; pointer-only demos show a dimmed “desktop only” notice on touch; progress ring centers vertically; `scrollbar-gutter` is desktop-only to reduce mobile scroll jitter.

## [0.8.12]

- **iOS gyroscope — retry until granted**: the motion-permission gate now retries on each genuine tap (a first tap that turns into a scroll no longer permanently gives up) and listens in the capture phase, using `click`/`touchend`.

## [0.8.11]

- **Packaging — leaner tarball**: `.DS_Store` and stray `.fuse_hidden*` filesystem artifacts are excluded from the published package via negation patterns in the `files` list (a plain `.npmignore` is bypassed when `files` whitelists whole folders). Publish size dropped and no junk files ship.

## [0.8.10]

- **Fix — iOS gyroscope (tilt + compass)**: motion effects stopped working on iOS because the DeviceOrientation permission was requested per-element from `pointerdown`, which recent WebKit no longer treats as a valid user-activation for the permission prompt. There is now one shared permission gate triggered by the first `click`/`touchend` anywhere on the page, so a single tap unlocks the gyroscope for every tilt and compass element at once.

## [0.8.9]

- **Counter (slot) — direction follows the count**: a decreasing counter (e.g. a 34,000 → 10,000 discount) now rolls its digits downward (new digits drop in from above), while an increasing counter still rolls upward. Previously every reel scrolled up regardless of direction.
- **Demo — narrow-phone responsiveness**: the card grid drops to a single fluid column below 560px (the old `minmax(330px,…)` forced horizontal overflow that clipped cards and the overflow-text bar on iPhone-width screens), the overflow-text bar is now fluid, and the settings drawer gets a dedicated ≤480px layout (single-column controls, tighter gutters, wrapping header actions).

## [0.8.8]

- **Fix — `replay()` now works for on-screen elements**: `Kineto.replay()` used to destroy and recreate the instance, which built a fresh ScrollTrigger that never fires `onEnter` for an element already in view — so reveal effects stayed frozen at their start (e.g. `wipe` showed a blank/white box, `class` hooks did nothing). Replay now calls the instance's own `replay()` in place, and reveal's replay plays the entrance as a one-shot independent of the scroll trigger.
- **Slider / Coverflow — true infinite loop**: `loop` now cycles seamlessly in both directions with no snap-back at the ends. Slides are rendered at their shortest distance around a ring (no cloned DOM nodes), so drag, buttons, keyboard and autoplay all wrap continuously. `loop` stays an opt-in option (off by default).
- **Cursor (orbit) — press feedback**: while the orbit ring is bloomed over a hover target, pressing now contracts it by `pressScale` so a click is felt.
- **Lightbox — share no longer closes the viewer**: dismissing the native share sheet by clicking the page previously registered as a backdrop click and closed the lightbox; close is now suppressed while sharing (and briefly after).
- **Demo — intro scroll lock restored**: scrolling is locked at the root while the intro is up, so lazy images loading in behind it no longer shift the layout and jolt the scroll position when the intro releases.
- **Demo — no layout jank on overflow toggle**: `scrollbar-gutter: stable` reserves the scrollbar's width, so toggling `overflow:hidden` (intro, sitemap, lightbox) no longer changes the page width.

## [0.8.7]

- **Lightbox — share, editable zoom, swipe, EXIF**: opt-in `share` button (Web Share API, falls back to copying the URL); click the zoom percentage to type an exact value (double-click resets); swipe left/right to change image on touch when not zoomed; opt-in `exif` reads camera/exposure tags from the file and appends them to the info line (best-effort — silently skipped when absent or CORS-blocked).
- **Higher-quality CRT / VCR**: added an RGB aperture-grille (phosphor stripes), softer vignette, a gentle non-strobe flicker and a slow refresh sweep; VCR now has analogue SVG-turbulence noise, chromatic bleed and a tracking band. CRT power-on toned down — removed the horizontal flip/overstretch and softened the roll bar and overexposure.
- **Demo — sitemap centering**: the Module Index overlay now opens centred on screen; header icon button vertically aligned.

- **Continuous CRT / VCR effect** (`data-kt-glitch="crt"` / `"vcr"` on an image): a CSS overlay with 1px scanlines, a sweeping roll bar, vignette and flicker; VCR adds tracking noise and a picture jitter. Lightweight (no canvas). Added to the Media & UI demo.
- **Fix — glitch no longer destroys images**: text glitch presets (rgb/noise) applied to an image (or any element without text) previously blanked the content to grey; they now no-op safely. Any glitch preset is safe on any target.
- **CRT power-on (`lazy` crt)**: added black roll bars sweeping up/down as the picture powers on, for a more convincing tube feel.
- **Card Glow — press / tap reaction**: pressing/tapping moves the light to the touch point and pulses a brightness burst (touch + corner taps get a response without hover).
- **Demo — Module Index sitemap**: a header button opens a full overview of every section; each entry jumps straight to that module (in-page anchors, no page transition).
- **Playground selects**: restored the dropdown arrow in the options drawer (a `background` shorthand was wiping the arrow image) and gave the value room on the right.

## [0.8.5]

- **New `lazy` effect — `crt`**: old CRT / cathode-ray TV power-on. A bright line snaps open, the picture expands vertically out of it with an overexposed bloom, then settles behind a faint scanline overlay. Added to the demo and the playground effect list.
- **Lightbox mobile toolbar**: on narrow screens the centered `1 / N` counter overlapped the zoom/close controls — it now drops into flow so the counter sits left and the controls right (no overlap); zoom/close buttons are square.
- **Demo mobile fixes**: lightbox thumbnail grid no longer overlaps (robust 2-column, square thumbnails); the ripple sample is more visible (higher opacity) so the effect reads on touch.
- **Tooling — CDN demo generator**: `npm run demo:cdn` (also part of `npm run build`) regenerates a deploy-ready `site/` copy of the demo with the Kineto script/style pinned to the exact CDN version — no more hand-editing the public demo on every update, and no stale-cache surprises. `site/` is git-ignored (build output).
- **README**: added an "AI vibe-coding" credit line to the footer of all seven language READMEs.

## [0.8.4]

- **ambientMedia performance**: the video-sampling loop now pauses when the element scrolls off-screen or the tab is hidden (IntersectionObserver + visibilitychange), instead of sampling every frame forever. Cuts background work on long pages and weaker mobile GPUs.
- **Demo**: lighter `backdrop-filter` blur on mobile (8px instead of 20px) to reduce Android scroll jank; hidden scrollbar on the fullpage "first-slide" host; header language select / theme switch vertically centered; dark-mode toggle knob given more contrast; guarded against stray horizontal scroll.
- **Repo hygiene**: `tests/` untracked (kept locally, ignored) and the duplicate root `README.ko.md` removed (Korean lives in `i18n/`).

## [0.8.3]

- **GSAP conflict when a CDN copy is also loaded**: Kineto bundles gsap + ScrollTrigger, but if the host page also loaded gsap from a CDN there were two gsap instances — ScrollTrigger registered on one while Kineto animated on the other, so every scrollTrigger tween failed ("Invalid property scrollTrigger … Missing plugin? gsap.registerPlugin()") and scroll-sequence, sticky-stack (floating/horizontal scale-fade), parallax scrub and textFill silently stopped. Kineto now prefers the gsap/ScrollTrigger already present on the page and registers the plugin, so loading them from a CDN no longer breaks anything (loading them is unnecessary either way).
- **Fullpage swipe on mobile**: vertical and mixed-axis decks now use `touch-action:none` and hand the gesture off to the outer scroll themselves at the first/last section, so swipes are captured reliably instead of competing with the page's native scroll — without trapping the page at the edges.
- **Playground**: pressing Apply on a touch device now gives a short success haptic.
- **Ripple on touch devices**: the click-ripple was suppressed on some mobile browsers because touch `pointerdown` can report a non-zero `button`. The guard now only ignores secondary *mouse* buttons, so taps on phones (iOS Safari, Android Chrome) trigger the ripple.
- **npm README fix**: the npm package now ships only the English `README.md`, so the package page reliably shows it instead of arbitrarily picking one of the translated `README.*.md` files. All translations remain available in the GitHub repository.

## [0.8.2]

- **Brand consistency**: replaced the remaining all-caps `MOTIONKIT` strings — including the default `cursor` ring/orbit/snake text shipped in the library — with `KINETO`. Demo header, title, and footer updated to the current version.
- **README**: English is the default README with the other languages linked; added the five headline effect previews (GIF) and a short note on the origin of the name (from *kinetic* / Greek *kínēsis*, "motion").

## [0.8.1]

- **Fix: framework adapters resolve the scoped package.** The React, Vue, and jQuery adapters imported the core as `kineto`; after the rename to `@dong-gri/kineto` that no longer resolved, breaking adapter users on 0.8.0. They now import `@dong-gri/kineto`.
- Removed a stray duplicated `demo/kineto/` directory from the package.

## [Unreleased]

### Added / Changed (release prep)

- **Counter `from`**: counters can start from any value, not just 0, and animate up or down to `to` (e.g. a 34,000 → 10,000 discount). `plain` tweens the value; `slot` rolls each digit reel from the start digit to the target in the correct direction. Exposed in the demo playground and shown in a new "Discount" card.
- **Fullpage scroll hand-off (Chrome mouse wheel)**: restored `overscroll-behavior:contain` on the pager to stop the compositor from chain-scrolling the parent on uncancelable wheel events, and drive the outer scroll manually at the edges so nothing gets trapped. Normalises `deltaMode` (line/page → px) for mice that don't report pixels. Inside a scroll container the deck only takes over once it is fully pinned, so scrolling back up lets the parent rise first.
- **Safari `file://` fix**: removed `?v=` cache-buster query strings from local demo resources — Safari refuses query strings on `file://` URLs, which had blocked the whole bundle from loading. The demo intro loader also has a failsafe so it can never leave the page blank.
- **Header (dark mode)**: the brand button now sets its own `color` (buttons don't inherit it), so the wordmark is visible in dark mode.
- **Release packaging**: package renamed to `@dong-gri/kineto` with repository/homepage/bugs/keywords and `publishConfig.access: public`; READMEs (ko/en/ja) rewritten; added `PUBLISH-GUIDE.md` and `VSCODE-GUIDE.md`; removed the stale `kineto-0.5.1-stabilized` snapshot and stray `.DS_Store` files.

### Changed / Added (round 24 — inline options panel & polish)

- **Options are a wide floating dock with a spotlight.** The panel is a wide bottom dock; the card being edited is lifted above a light dim (no blur on the example) and scrolled into view, so you watch the live effect while adjusting. Toss/Supabase-style layout: grouped setting cards, label + value on one row, boolean toggles as switches, focus rings, and the code preview tucked into a collapsible "코드 보기" drawer. Actions (Replay/Apply/Reset/close) live in a sticky head; the sheet keeps its rounded top.
- **Fullpage — real mixed axis.** A single sequence can change direction per step: `axis:"mixed"` with `data-kt-fp-axis="x|y"` on each section (e.g. A→B→C horizontal, C→D vertical). Sections are placed on a 2D grid and the track translates in both axes. Added to the playground axis select.
- **Fullpage coexists with normal scroll.** At an edge it can't move toward, the wheel gesture is now fully released — even mid-gesture — so an outer scroll container or the page takes over. New demo: two slides that hand off to a normal-scroll area + footer ("첫 화면만 슬라이드").
- **Cursor orbit** demo now has a hover target so the ellipse→circle bloom is visible; **cursor image** demo shows the click burst (`clickSprite`/`clickImage` fire on click for any cursor type).
- **Glitch** gains a `reveal` preset: the flicker/decode-in load effect as a one-shot on an image, with its own `duration`.
- **Haptic** buttons show a toast on PC/iOS explaining vibration only fires on supported (mainly Android) hardware, instead of silently doing nothing.
- The Customize summary now scrolls long / translated module names with Kineto's own overflowText instead of clipping them.
- Lightbox Viewer grid rows trimmed to a fixed height so images no longer overlap the Customize summary.
- **Brand symbol.** New Kineto mark (`assets/logo.svg` / `demo/favicon.svg`) — a rounded tile with an object tracing an easing curve and a fading motion trail. Wired into the demo header (replacing the plain square), the favicon, and all READMEs.
- **Reusable toast** (`window.ktToast(msg)`): multi-line via `\n`, always centered, one shared component. Used by the copy buttons ("복사되었습니다"), Apply/Reset/Replay, and the Haptic-unsupported hint.
- **Fullpage release fix.** Dropped `overscroll-behavior:contain` on the container — because it's an overflow:hidden scroll container, `contain` was blocking wheel chaining and trapping the gesture. The wheel handoff is now gesture-scoped: while the deck can move, a whole flick is hijacked (one step, outer never scrolls); the outer scroller only takes over on a *fresh* gesture once the deck is exhausted — so fullpage and page never scroll at the same time. The coexistence demo fills its host and its normal-scroll area has a warm tint so it no longer reads as an error.
- **Lightbox fade speed fix.** When a lightbox shares `data-kt-duration` with another module on the same element (e.g. a lazy loader), the loader's long duration used to bleed into the backdrop fade. New `lightboxDuration` option (`data-kt-lightbox-duration`) overrides just the viewer fade; default lowered to 0.12s. The ambient/animated demo lightboxes now open/close at the same speed as the Lightbox Viewer.

### Fixed / Added (round 23 — media fixes, real photos & cursor hover)

- **ambientMedia no longer breaks on option change**: live edits rebuild only the edited module (single `rebuildModule`), so a stacked card (ambient over a lazy image + lightbox) never tears its own subtree out. Full "Apply" tears down then recreates inner-before-container.
- Lightbox demo opens fast (gallery `duration:0.12`, entry animation 240→170ms).
- Cursor image/custom react to hover: `hoverSrc` swaps the image, `hoverTemplate` swaps the custom HTML, `hoverClass` adds a class for your own CSS. Demo Image/Custom cards show it (image swap, DRAG→OPEN).
- **Real photo gallery**: 6 supplied images optimized to webp (28–64KB) and wired into the Lightbox Viewer (now 6, tidy 3-col grid, no overlap with the panel), Slider/Coverflow, Image Glitch, Brush Reveal and all Image Loading Effects cards.
- The Customize summary module name uses Kineto's own overflowText (bounce, pause on hover) when it's wider than its slot — also covers longer translated strings.

### Added (round 22 — counter/cursor customization & drawer notes)

- Counter flip (incl. clock/countdown): `seamColor` (fold-line color), `shadow` (toggle/custom drop-shadow), and `separatorColor` (comma/colon color) — all also overridable via CSS vars `--kt-counter-seam`, `--kt-counter-flip-shadow`, `--kt-counter-separator`.
- Cursor **snake**: eased, gentler shrink (`snakeMinScale`, sqrt curve) so glyphs stay legible instead of collapsing instantly.
- Cursor **orbit**: blooms from a flat ellipse into a larger full circle on hover over links (`orbitHoverScale`).
- Cursor **image / custom**: added demo cards + full tooltips (the HELP set never had a `cursor` module before — now ko/en, others fall back to en), with `src/width/height` and `template` exposed in the panel.
- clickSprite already auto-detects frame size/count; the demo now omits explicit sizes to show it, and the verbose sprite-sheet explanation moved into the drawer as a `data-kt-note` block (a reusable "notes in the settings drawer" mechanism).

### Changed (round 21 — full i18n tooltips, scramble & footer)

- Option `?` tooltips are now translated in **all 7 languages** (ko/en/ja/zh-CN/zh-TW/ru/it, 291 entries each, full key parity) in `demo/help-i18n.js`, switching live with the language selector.
- Scramble: `scrambleFade` now takes precedence over `rainbow` — when fade is on, scrambling uses brightness only (no color). `textReveal` flicker mode no longer applies rainbow (decode only).
- Settings apply is fail-safe: options the current preset doesn't support (WHEN-hidden) are dropped before create, and a bad combo can't blank the demo — it restores the captured defaults with a note.
- Intro loader percentage is black on a light brand canvas (no more cyan difference blend); GitHub buttons use the Phosphor GitHub icon; footer rewritten in natural Korean with a line break, `dongri.me` creator link, MIT + "AI 바이브코딩으로 제작" note (also in README).

### Added (round 20 — release packaging & demo polish)

- **Minified distributables + CDN**: `npm run build` now also emits `dist/kineto.min.js` (ESM, rolldown-minified, gzip ~62KB), `dist/kineto.umd.min.js` (CDN drop-in) and `dist/kineto.min.css`. `package.json` `unpkg`/`jsdelivr` fields point at the min UMD, and `exports` adds `./min` and `./umd`.
- **README bundle documentation**: a "번들 · 배포 포맷" table (file / format / use / gzip size) plus CDN (`jsdelivr`/`unpkg`), ESM CDN (`/+esm`), and optional GSAP/Lenis snippets; demo install box points at the npm CDN paths.
- **Tooltip i18n**: option `?` tooltips are now multilingual (`demo/help-i18n.js`, Korean + full English, 291 entries) and follow the language selector with per-key English→Korean fallback (ja/zh/ru/it fall back to English).
- **Phosphor Icons** across the demo chrome (via jsDelivr CDN): replay FABs, theme switch (sun/moon), hero support icons — replacing the hand-rolled inline SVGs that overlapped/looked off. The library itself stays icon-font-free (zero dependencies).
- **Intro loader redesign**: oversized thin Wanted Sans percentage (clamp up to 14rem, weight 100), a `KINETO` monospace wordmark, and `difference` blend so the number stays vivid over both the dark start and the rising orange fill.

### Fixed (round 19 — release QA)

- Intro loader was invisible on fast/cached loads twice over: the "already loaded → skip" branch always won on file://, and the whole-page fade veil (`body{opacity:0}`) also hid the loader overlay. The loader now always shows (resolved promise + minDuration) and the fade veil only covers the content containers (header/layout/footer), never the overlay.
- Loader scroll lock now locks the **root scroller** too (body overflow alone doesn't propagate when `<html>` has `overflow-x:clip`) and restores both on exit/destroy — applies to every loader, not just the intro.
- Intro percentage set in thin Wanted Sans (variable weight 100, tabular numerals) — `!important`ed over the module's inline slot typography.
- demo-qa waits for the deferred module boot before asserting.
- **Release QA sweep** (headless, full demo): 40 replay FABs, 87 option panels opened/changed/closed, lightbox open→nav→zoom→reset→close, 3 loaders with scroll-lock/restore, page reveals, fullpage round-trip, slider next/prev, 7-language cycle, theme round-trip, `Kineto.destroy()` → 0 instances → re-init — **zero page/console errors**. Full suite green: contract 34, owner requirements 46, package surface, utils/SSR, browser smoke; demo-qa passes except the sandbox-only H.264 video assert.

### Added (round 18 — demo split, Page Reveal panel & fixes)

- Demo split into `index.html` / `styles.css` / `main.js` (pre-paint theme/preload scripts stay inline by design); QA/requirement tests read the split files.
- Page Reveal card gained a full Customize panel (effect/direction/duration/delay/colors/pieces/stagger/angle) — the effect buttons and the panel share the same options.
- Loader: `exit:'slide'` is directional now (exitDirection or the fill direction), and `exit:'wipe'` actually sweeps — the mask transition had no start state, so it snapped instead of animating.
- Scramble options broke when the painter moved into utils (the option names vanished from the modules' contract extraction, so the playground filtered `data-kt-rainbow` & co. away) — modules now pass the options explicitly; rainbow / palette-range / fade all work from the drawer.
- Drawer field show/hide had silently stopped (descriptor kind guard was too broad) — WHEN-based visibility works again for every module.
- Mobile: the hero column was locked at 640px by its content and got clipped — it now stretches to the container (100%/min-width:0), verified at 390px.
- First visit: the whole page fades in (0.65s) the moment the preload veil lifts, with the entrance choreography playing underneath (skipped under reduced motion).

### Added (round 17 — loader fill everywhere & snap-x wheel)

- The intro's background-fill treatment is now a first-class **loader option set**, exposed in the Loading playground: `fill` (up/down/left/right), `fillColor`, `labelColor`, `labelBlend` (difference/exclusion/screen/overlay) — and a new **`exit:'wipe'` directional mask-out** that sweeps the finished overlay away (`exitDirection` defaults to the fill direction). The demo's Run slot ships with fill-up + difference label + wipe exit.
- Fullpage: wheel now works in `mode:'snap'` + `axis:'x'` (vertical wheel steps the horizontal snap container, gesture-grouped like transform mode).
- Cursor sprite auto-probe moved off the options object (WeakMap) so the feature contract stays clean.

### Added (round 16 — deterministic startup, axes everywhere & full i18n)

- **Deterministic startup (library + demo)**: new `kt-preload` convention — an inline script adds the class to `<html>` at first paint, entrance-animated elements stay invisible (kineto.css rules), and `scan()` releases the veil after modules apply their initial states. No more content flashing before its entrance plays, on any connection speed. The demo defers all module init to window `load`, covered by a **slot intro loader** (orange, thin mono type) whose background fills like a giant progress bar.
- **loader**: `fill` ('up'/'down'/'left'/'right') fills the overlay background with `fillColor` as progress rises; `labelColor` + `labelBlend` (e.g. `difference`) keep the percentage readable over the fill.
- **fullpage**: `axis:'x'` (horizontal paging — dots at bottom, arrow keys, nesting inside a vertical container gives mixed layouts), mouse **drag-swipe** (`drag`, on by default), and snap mode actually scrolls now (the percent chain was collapsing; dots sync to native snapping). Horizontal demo card added.
- **slider/coverflow**: `axis:'y'` — vertical sliding and vertical coverflow (rotateX), drag and arrow keys follow the axis.
- **Scramble styling** shared by shuffle + textReveal decode/flicker: `rainbow`, `rainbowColors` (hex/rgba stops sampled algorithmically instead of the full rainbow) and `scrambleFade` (brightness-only flicker).
- **vibrate**: `trigger:'manual'` + `instance.play()` for firing patterns from code; every module's JS code tab now shows selector-based usage (`Kineto.module('#id'|'.class', options)`).
- **cursor clickSprite** auto-detects frame size/count from the sheet (square frames assumed) when width/frames are omitted — explicit options still win.
- **tilt / cardGlow**: `disableOnMobile` switches the effect off entirely on touch devices.
- **i18n completed**: all 68 card descriptions translated into the 6 languages (plus chips/tooltips/support/footer); tooltips wrap at punctuation (`white-space:pre-line`).
- Lightbox: clicking the empty area beside the image now closes the viewer (drag/zoom-safe) — the stage was swallowing backdrop clicks; gallery demo grew to 4 images.
- Playground: drawer controls use the accent color (no more UA blue); the GSAP/LENIS install rows really hide now (`[hidden]` was losing to `display:flex`).

### Added (round 15 — clock everywhere, no-flicker drawer & hero refinements)

- Counter clock family gained `clockStyle:'flip'` — real time, countdown and elapsed timers can now render as a split-flap board (tile options fully compatible), alongside roll/fade/instant.
- Options drawer no longer flickers: option changes sync field visibility **in place** (fields toggle `hidden`) instead of rebuilding the panel; ESC closes the drawer and returns focus to its trigger.
- Module Index badges jump to the section demoing that module (keyboard accessible).
- Page Reveal `diagonal` rebuilt as a real angled curtain sweep (slanted cover + trailing panel, `angle`/`direction` options) — no more corner shrink.
- Hero: dependency toggles (Scroll Scrub / Smooth Scroll, English labels) sit inline in the support line and reveal the matching GSAP/LENIS CDN rows; chips renamed (간편설치 · 구형 브라우저 고려 · …) with centered, caret-arrow tooltips that break lines at punctuation; chip labels/tooltips, support line and footer brand are translated in all 7 languages; hero-meta spacing 50px; install badges auto-size (LENIS no longer cramped).
- Detail pass: summary flex gap 2px; Card Glow cards get a wider option panel (escaping the 50px card padding) with relaxed tracking, and their content stacks centered with a 12px gap.

### Added (round 14 — first-screen snap, 7 languages & final polish)

- Demo hero is a full-viewport (100svh) first screen: one scroll gesture snaps to the first section fullpage-style — and scrolling up from there snaps back — with gesture-grouped momentum swallowing on wheel and touch; everything below scrolls normally. Disabled under prefers-reduced-motion. The header brand (Kineto 0.8.0) scrolls to the top on click.
- Language selector grew to 7 languages: 한국어 · English · 日本語 · 简体中文 · 繁體中文 · Русский · Italiano (section copies + hero lead, `<html lang>` synced).
- Hero feature chips rewritten in plain Korean with centered hover tooltips (arrow caret) explaining each point; the dependency line now says it plainly — the core runs standalone, and an "PLUS" install row provides copyable GSAP + ScrollTrigger + Lenis CDN tags for the scroll-scrub/smooth modules.
- Counter countdown rolls digits downward by default (they're decreasing); `rollDirection` still overrides.

### Fixed (round 14)

- Snake cursor restored to the original loose elastic chain — and when the letters converge at rest, each glyph scales down with its spread so the stack collapses into a 1–2px dot (measured scale 0.12) instead of a letter blob.
- Slider/Coverflow: the Prev/Next row sat flush against the options summary — cards with real control rows keep a separated panel with proper spacing (16px, own border and radius).
- Module Index group labels vertically centered against their chip rows.

### Fixed (round 13 — gesture isolation & detail pass)

- **Fullpage really swallows momentum now**: wheel events are grouped into gestures (280ms window) — once a gesture triggers a step, its entire momentum tail is preventDefault-ed, and touch swipes navigate at the threshold then consume the rest of the touch. `overscroll-behavior:contain` blocks scroll chaining on mobile. Verified: 14 rapid wheel events → exactly one section step, 0px page movement.
- Theme switch: states were inverted — dark mode now highlights the moon (knob on the moon side), light highlights the sun; icons are larger filled monochrome glyphs (no accent colors).
- "Blink colon" (and other true-by-default checkboxes: seconds, lightbox toolbar/info/minimap, fullpage dots/wheel/touch/keyboard) rendered unchecked in the drawer while actually on — defaults registered so the panel reflects and controls them correctly.
- Counter digits clipped in narrow cards — counter stages use container queries to scale the type down (with the old vw clamp as fallback), everything centered and fully visible.
- Content Entrance preview cards now join their Customize summary (shared corner radii) like every other section.
- Footer: the top border runs full-bleed and meets the sidebar divider (no more floating inset line with a dead gap above it).

### Added (round 12 — clock modes, countdown & theme switch)

- Counter clock: `clockStyle` (roll · fade · instant), `rollDirection` (up/down), **countdown** (`until`) and **elapsed** (`since`) modes with automatic day count (`daysLabel`, `showDays`) and onComplete at zero; the layout rebuilds itself when the day digits change. Reduced motion renders plain updating text for all clock modes. Demo gains a Countdown card (D-day to 2027).
- Theme control is now a real switch — sun/moon at each end, sliding knob, `role="switch"` + `aria-checked`, larger icons.
- Install box: npm row is a copyable `npm install kineto` like the others; CDN/ESM snippets point at `dong-gri/kineto`.

### Fixed (round 12)

- Brush Reveal at `opacity:1` never looked opaque: the trail fade ran *after* the re-stamp (permanently one step below full), and the blur filter diluted the core. The loop now fades first then stamps, and a crisp unfiltered core is re-laid over the blurred pass — opacity 1 is truly opaque.
- Fullpage: wheel/touch during a section transition is swallowed completely, so the page behind no longer scrolls mid-animation (verified 0px page movement); the demo container and its Customize summary now share joined corner radii.
- The sidebar divider ended with the sticky nav and looked cut off next to the footer — the border moved to the main column, running the full content height.

### Added (round 11 — fullpage, progress UI & clock) — 34 modules

- **fullpage** (new 34th module): fullpage.js-style section paging — wheel / touch swipe / keyboard / dot navigation, `mode:'snap'` for native scroll-snap, loop, callbacks. Percent-based transforms adapt to any resize instantly; the container releases scroll at its edges so it never traps the page; reduced motion falls back to native snap scrolling.
- **progress** module grew visual shapes: `ui:'bar'` (fixed or in-place track+fill, thickness/radius/gradient/trackColor/position) and `ui:'ring'` (SVG circle, size/stroke, `showPercent`, `clickToTop` back-to-top button, corner + offset, `showAfter`, `hideAtEnd`, smoothing, per-element `target`). Themable via `--kt-progress-*` variables. The demo's floating TOP button is now this ring.
- **counter**: `clock` mode — a live clock (HH:MM:SS) where only changing digits roll and the colon blinks each second (`seconds`, `hour12`, `blink`, `clockSeparator`, `rollDuration`); grouping separator accepts any character (`separator`), and `blinkSeparators` makes separators blink in the other modes. Reduced motion renders a plain updating time.
- **shuffle**: `rainbow` option — scrambled characters flash in random rainbow colors (or a custom `rainbowColors` palette) until they settle.
- **pageReveal**: three new effects — `checker` (random tile grid), `strips` (shuffled vertical strips), `shutter` (alternating horizontal blades).

### Fixed (round 11)

- **Hero markup had one extra `</div>`** (introduced with the install box), which closed `<main>` early and spilled every section out of the layout grid — breaking the sidebar's sticky positioning. Rebalanced; sidebar sticks again.
- Hero title: the text-reveal char split defeated `background-clip:text` (giant black blocks). The title is now a static element with the flowing gradient glow.
- Marquee `pauseOnHover` never actually paused: the scroll-recovery drift pulled the velocity back to base every frame. Hover now holds the line still (verified: 0px movement while hovered).
- Header scroll bar moved inside the header (it sat above it, and its unfilled track showed an unblurred 2px gap).

### Added (round 10 — hero identity & lightbox polish)

- Lightbox: `backdropBlur` option (px, 0 disables) alongside `backdropOpacity`; zoom −/+/reset buttons disable themselves at min/max/100%; the whole viewer is now designer-themable via CSS custom properties (`--kt-lightbox-backdrop`, `--kt-lightbox-backdrop-blur`, `--kt-lightbox-button-bg/-border/-color/-radius`, `--kt-lightbox-radius`) — explicit JS options still win.
- Demo: hero title flows with an animated gradient glow (disabled under prefers-reduced-motion); theme switch is a sun/moon icon toggle; floating TOP button bottom-right (sits above the mobile nav); install box with copyable CDN/ESM snippets and an "npm 준비 중" row replaces the three wordy fact cards; custom cursors switch to `mix-blend-mode:difference` while the lightbox is open so they stay visible over the dim.

### Fixed (round 10)

- Stage ↔ Customize summary joining now applies to every card section (Counter, image loading, Text Overflow, feedback, Text Motion, entrance, Media & UI, cursor) — not just Loading.
- Replay buttons that sat outside a `.replay-row` (media cards) were still text buttons; the FAB conversion now catches every replay control.
- Card Glow cards force white text, which made the panel summary invisible in light theme — panels now set their own text color and stretch to full card width.
- Section copies rewritten as natural two-line Korean (with matching EN), `<a class="btn">` links lose their underline, and the Page Transition card explains itself in two sentences.

### Changed (round 9 — hero/footer & sticky fix)

- Hero: demo buttons and the "Live playground" notice removed; replaced with a GitHub link, feature chips (progressive enhancement, reduced-motion, mobile/gyro, standards/a11y) and three fact cards — browser support, optional dependencies (GSAP · ScrollTrigger · Lenis), install (UMD/ESM, npm 준비 중). Lead copy now breaks into two lines.
- Footer redesigned: brand statement + Project / Release columns + fine print; build stamp kept.
- Replay FAB moved to the bottom-right of each stage; dropped the `btn` class so later-cascade button styles can't hide or reshape it.
- Loader preview stages and their Customize summary now join into one block (shared corner radii, no gap); summaries elsewhere get more top margin, module name in the summary is right-aligned, standalone playground hosts span full width.
- Options drawer slides in from the right; shadow softened.
- Page Transition card gained a live "Transition reload" link (falls back to normal navigation where fetch is unavailable).

### Fixed (round 9)

- **Sticky broke site-wide** (Scroll Sequence showed a long empty run): `overflow-x:hidden` on `<body>` stopped propagating to the viewport once `<html>` got `overflow-x:clip`, turning the body into a clip container that killed `position:sticky`. Removed the body rule — the html clip alone prevents horizontal scroll.
- Brush Reveal: faint ghost no longer lingers — fade accelerates 4× once remaining ink is faint, so the tail snaps away.

### Added (round 8 — mobile & polish)

- Lightbox: two-finger pinch zoom on touch; mobile safe-area insets for toolbar, nav arrows and bottom metadata; `closeOnBackdrop` option exposed in the playground.
- Brush reveal: scratch-card behavior on touch (`touch-action:none`, paint starts on touch-down); trail healing — older strokes fade continuously while the spot under the pointer stays re-inked every frame.
- Cursor click effects work on touch devices (tap spawns the sprite/one-shot image even though pointer visuals stay disabled).
- Marquee: `skew` option — the line leans with scroll velocity and springs back.
- Slider: horizontal swipe wins over page scroll once a drag starts (touch).
- Demo: mobile bottom navigation bar (scroll-spy chips, safe-area aware); module index grouped by category (Text/Media/Scroll/Pointer/System); replay is a floating icon on each stage; options drawer portals to `<body>` so it renders correctly from tilted cards.

### Fixed (round 8)

- `--font-mono` definition became self-referential during a global font replacement, silently invalidating every `font: … var(--font-mono)` shorthand (section numbers rendered giant). Restored the full stack; numbers now render at the requested 16px IBM Plex Mono.
- Mobile horizontal scroll removed (`overflow-x: clip` on the root scroller); Korean copy no longer breaks mid-word (`word-break: keep-all`, `text-wrap: pretty`).
- Playground: LIVE badge removed, summary slimmed with a fixed-width +/− glyph (no text shift), open-state keeps the border radius; the `?` tooltip opens downward inside the drawer without spawning a horizontal scrollbar.
- Text Motion stages have fixed heights so cycling text no longer reflows the page while scrolling (덜컹거림 해소).

### Added (round 7)

- Vibrate: named haptic presets — `tap`, `double-tap`, `soft`, `rigid`, `heavy`, `success`, `warning`, `error`, `ratchet`(드르륵), `heartbeat`, `long-press` (Web Vibration API has no amplitude control, so texture comes from pulse timing).
- Tilt: gyroscope fallback on touch devices (device orientation drives the tilt; iOS permission handled on first tap).
- Compass: follows the real device heading via gyroscope on mobile.
- Sticky Stack: `align: center | top` — pinned content now centers in the viewport by default (vertical stack, horizontal scroll and floating sequence).
- Cursor: click effects — `clickSprite` (sprite-sheet burst with frame count/size/duration) or `clickImage` (one-shot GIF/APNG/WebP, restarted via cache-busted src). Touch devices still disable cursors entirely.
- Demo: language selector (KO/EN, persisted) replaces the header counter link; theme choice persisted to localStorage; Wanted Sans (body) + IBM Plex Mono (mechanical/numeric type) via CDN.
- Demo structure: Cursor and Smooth Scroll split — the Lenis runtime card now lives in Scroll Effects.

### Fixed (round 7)

- Sidebar/앵커 잠김 완전 해결: `overflow-anchor`를 실제 스크롤러(html)에 적용하고, 해시 이동을 JS 스크롤 + `replaceState`로 바꿔 브라우저의 fragment 재고정이 아예 발동하지 않게 함.
- Ambient image glitch: 색수차 고스트·인버트 슬라이스·스캔라인을 추가해 플랫한 일러스트에서도 버스트가 확실히 보이도록 강화.
- Brush reveal: 호버 중 정지해도 칠이 유지되고(치유는 포인터가 떠난 뒤 시작), 브러시 중심이 기본 불투명(`opacity` 옵션), file:// 이미지에서 치유가 멈추던 taint 문제 제거(픽셀 판독 없는 잉크 추적).
- Lightbox 딤드가 커서 위를 덮어 포인터가 사라지던 z-index 역전 수정.
- Section 번호 타이포를 IBM Plex Mono 기반으로 작고 타이트하게 조정.

### Added (round 6)

- Counter pop: landing origin option `popAlign: bottom | center | top`.
- Lazy skeleton: `skeletonColor` / `skeletonHighlight` / `skeletonIcon` exposed in the playground.
- Overflow Text `page-roll` mode: no horizontal marquee at all — the first page holds, then remaining pages swap by vertical rolling only (`rollDuration`, `rollDirection`, `pageDuration`).
- Glitch `image` preset: standalone ambient glitch bursts over a live image (independent from lazy loading; `sliceCount`, `trigger: hover` supported).
- Brush reveal: real airbrush spread — `softness` now scales the falloff band, plus `blur` for extra gaussian edge.
- Playground: options irrelevant to the current preset are hidden (live re-filter on preset change), and every option has a `?` tooltip with a friendly Korean explanation.
- Demo layout overhaul: sticky sidebar navigation with numbered sections and scroll-spy highlighting; compact hero; uniform card grid (`build r8-20260718`).

### Fixed (round 6)

- Rolling + pauseOnHover: hovering mid-roll restarted a cancelled animation from frame 0 and dropped scheduled steps (freezing on the wrong item); running animations now pause/resume properly and deferred steps fire on pointer-leave.

### Added (round 5 — 33 modules)

- **brushReveal** (new module): pointer paints a second image through a soft Photoshop-style round brush (day→night masking); strokes heal back or persist (`radius`, `softness`, `fade`, `persist`).
- Reveal `clock` preset: conic clock-wipe mask sweeps the content in like a watch hand (`startAngle`, `clockDirection`).
- Mouse Parallax `compass` mode: element rotates to aim at the pointer along the shortest arc, or maps pointer X onto a rotation range (`compassRange`, `rotateOffset`, `smoothing`, `sensitivity`).
- Text Reveal `decode` mode (RF Online style): characters appear in order, flickering through random glyphs before settling — generated from live text, no per-char markup (`flickerCount`, `loop`, `hold`, `chars`).
- Text Reveal `flicker` mode (Callisto TextFlicker): characters strobe on irregularly like failing fluorescents; `flickerLoop` keeps an ambient re-flicker running.
- Lazy `flicker` effect (Callisto ImageFlicker): image loads through canvas slice displacements, blackout flashes and a ghost pass, then settles (`glitchStrength`, `sliceCount`).
- Slider: active slide now centers in plain slide mode too; `align: 'left'` restores edge alignment.
- Cursor: small `+` cross-point variant kept alongside the full-viewport crosshair (`full: false`, `crosshairSize`).

### Fixed (round 5)

- Full-viewport crosshair was invisible: the transformed cursor wrapper became the containing block for its fixed hairlines and collapsed them to 0×0.
- Cursor hover label now sits centered inside the grown dot (no more collision with the ring outline); the dot auto-grows to fit the label.
- Page Reveal buttons only worked once: instances are one-shot and the demo now drops the previous record before re-running.
- Text/overflow dissolve no longer blurs (read as glow); Text Transition gained the same noisy `dissolve` effect.
- Demo: dark editorial redesign is now the default theme (orange accent, mono section numbering); scroll anchoring disabled to prevent snap-back while effects animate; assets cache-busted per build (`build r6-20260718`).

### Added (round 4)

- Overflow Text: `dissolve` mode — characters flicker apart with jitter/micro-blur noise (not a crossfade) and reassemble as the next page (`dissolveDuration`, `jitter`).
- Overflow Text rolling: items can be HTML markup children (div/span/b/em…), not just strings; aria-label uses the plain text.
- Cursor: hover now grows the inner dot while the ring/text-ring keeps its size (`hoverEffect: 'dot' | 'ring'`, `hoverDotSize`, `hoverDotOpacity`).

### Fixed (round 4)

- Overflow Text page/flip/once truncated the tail of the text: overflow was measured against the padded element box instead of the content viewport.
- Coverflow: the last slide never landed dead-center — slide width was measured from a scaled/rotated side slide; now uses layout width.
- Lightbox: title/description moved directly under the image (fade out while zoomed); metadata floated up from the screen edge.

### Fixed (round 3)

- Demo assets are now cache-busted (`?v=r3-20260718`): Chrome kept serving a stale `dist/kineto.umd.js` from the file:// cache, which made every new module look broken (typewriter hangul/caret, text transition, glitch, new cursors, shuffle fix). The footer shows the build stamp.
- Counter flip: bare mode no longer flashes shaded boxes — fold shading only applies to tiles.
- Cursor sparkle: pooled stars restarted mid-transition and never became visible after the first burst; transitions are now re-armed per spawn so stars keep coming.
- Overflow Text: full timing control — `speed`, `delay`(시작), `endPause`(끝 대기), new `restartDelay`(한 사이클 후 재시작 대기), `pageDuration`/`flipDuration` — all exposed in the playground.
- Demo visual refresh: numbered section headers, refined light/dark palettes, softer card shadows with hover states, cleaner hero/footer.

### Added (round 2)

- Typewriter: caret(|) on/off (`caret`, `caretChar`) and Hangul jamo-composition typing (`hangul`) — merges the old Hangul reveal demo into Typewriter.
- Counter: true split-flap `flip` mode — each digit folds at the middle like a Solari board; tile chrome optional (`tile`, `tileColor`, `tileTextColor`, `tileRadius`, `bareBackground`, `gap`).
- Overflow Text: `flip` mode — page-sized text flips like a departure board (`flipDuration`, `flipDirection`).
- Card Glow: `comet` mode — traveling gradient light along the card outline (original border glow, with optional soft halo).
- Cursor: reference set restored — `text` (rotating circular text), `trail` (elastic dot tail), `orbit`, `snake`, `sparkle` (star particles), full-viewport `crosshair`.
- Page Reveal: `blinds`, `diagonal` effects plus `direction`, `axis`, `count`, `stagger` options; rebuilt on WAAPI.
- Text Transition: `shimmer` (AI gradient sweep) and `charMode` per-character enter/leave.

### Fixed (round 2)

- Glitch and Text Transition rebuilt without animation-engine dependency (WAAPI); glitch picks screen/multiply blending from the background so RGB slices are visible on light themes too.
- Skeleton placeholder now fills the actual image box instead of collapsing into a thin bar.
- Shuffle locks per-glyph widths so multi-line text can no longer collapse to one line mid-scramble.
- Demo playground: removed the rule that expanded a card to span 6 columns when its panel opened (grid no longer breaks); grids top-align cards.
- Lightbox: index counter truly centered, title/description centered under the image, metadata centered at the bottom edge.

### Added

- Text Split: `spin`, `flip`, `scale`, `blur`, `slide-up`, `slide-down` entrance animations plus Toss-style text swap (`texts`, `hold`, `swapOut`, `swapEase`, `onSwap`).
- Card Glow: restored the original rotating conic `aurora` outer halo that leaks beyond the card edge.
- Cursor: scoped cursors (`data-kt-cursor` on a bounded element activates only inside it), `full` crosshair, `dot` toggle for ring mode, `global`/`hideDotOnHover` options.
- Lazy Polaroid: instant-photo development curve with optional paper frame (`frame`, `frameColor`, `keepFrame`).
- Lazy Print: soft printing-edge highlight (`edgeWidth`, `edgeOpacity`) with eased scan.
- Lazy Skeleton: media-icon placeholder (`skeletonIcon`) and refined diagonal shimmer.
- Lightbox: index counter, item fade/rise transition, grab/grabbing pan cursors.

### Changed

- Pixelate now runs on the owner's Pixel Mosaic engine: real pixel-block stages in CSS pixels (auto largest→1px), equal time slices, canvas redraw of the live `<img>` so animated media keeps playing (`steps` in px, `stepCount`, `renderFps`, `maxDpr`; legacy ratio options still map).
- `zoom` lazy preset merged into `blur-up` (duplicate effect removed from the contract).
- Cursor dot now tracks the pointer instantly while the follower eases behind it (original trailing feel), and global cursors yield inside scoped regions so two cursors never overlap.
- Slider/Coverflow rebuilt on a single rAF-spring position engine: drag, buttons, keyboard, autoplay share one value; velocity fling on release; collapsed-height bug fixed.
- Overflow Text rewind/page masks now run on the visible viewport instead of the full track, with soft directional nudge easing.
- Scroll Text Fill uses fractional per-glyph gradient fill for a continuous sweep.
- Lightbox visual refresh: blurred backdrop, ghost buttons, compact nav.

### Fixed

- package-lock.json pointed at a private registry mirror, breaking `npm install` outside that network; regenerated against registry.npmjs.org.
- Slider first-slide inline height was cleared, collapsing wrappers without CSS min-height.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-07-18

### Added

- Added animated-media-safe composition across Lazy, Ambient Media and Lightbox for GIF, APNG and animated WebP.
- Added Skeleton shimmer/pulse variants, dynamic-noise Progressive Print/Dissolve, directional MP3 masks, realtime ranking rolling, surface reflection, luminous border, Reveal class hooks, spring velocity controls, full viewer controls, real Loader sources, custom cursor modes and optional Lenis runtime APIs.
- Expanded the owner contract to 46 requirements and the live demo to 58 configurable playgrounds.

### Changed

- Rebuilt Pixelate and Print around live image layers instead of permanently flattening animated media to canvas.
- Rebuilt Ambient Media to use live image clones or sampled video frames.
- Rebuilt Lightbox as a full-viewport customizable grouped viewer with lazy-effect composition.
- Rebuilt Coverflow around one transform path and removed the duplicate demo button handler.

### Fixed

- Fixed Skeleton creating an overlay object without appending it to the lazy wrapper.
- Fixed Coverflow moving two slides per demo button click.
- Fixed Smooth service recursive teardown and media wrapper insertion edge cases.
- Fixed zoomed Lightbox stages capturing pointer events from Previous/Next controls.
- Fixed animated-media QA stalls by replacing stability-dependent screenshots with direct CDP capture and deterministic Ambient frame markers.
- Corrected module documentation that still described Pixelate as Canvas-based and Lightbox as a native dialog.

## [0.7.1] - 2026-07-18

### Added

- Added a reusable live playground to adjustable demos with module-specific controls, instant re-creation, Replay, Apply, and Reset.
- Added synchronized HTML and JavaScript code tabs with a working clipboard action.
- Added playground QA that changes Counter options, verifies generated code and copy behavior, resets the original DOM, and checks instance-count stability.
- Added `MK-DEMO-002` to the owner requirements contract so future AI-assisted edits cannot silently remove the playground.

### Changed

- Included the `demo` directory in the npm package surface.
- Expanded open playground cards on desktop for a more usable settings layout.
- Cleaned generated JavaScript options by filtering them through each module's public option contract.

### Fixed

- Fixed asynchronous clipboard handlers losing `event.currentTarget` after `await`.
- Kept Loader demo buttons and playground controls on the same live option state.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-07-18

### Corrected

- Reclassified `circular` and `bar` as Loader modes and removed `circular` from Counter.
- Changed Counter `pop` to render the final formatted value immediately and land characters sequentially from a larger scale without count-up.
- Restored the Material-style button `ripple` module and separated Pointer/Button Feedback from Card Glow/Tilt.
- Rebuilt Lazy effects so `skeleton` is a true shimmer placeholder, `print` is blur + fine noise resolving through a directional sharp scan, and `dissolve` globally removes fine noise and blur.
- Moved `slide-up` and `wipe` into viewport-triggered Reveal presets instead of image Lazy loading.
- Restored the original RGB slice Glitch and repaired replayable Shuffle Decode and Text Transition.
- Made MP3 overflow modes distinct: Bounce reverses, Rewind masks out and invisibly resets, and Page changes instantly by viewport-width steps.
- Repaired Coverflow controls/drag/index, Ambient Media stacking, and grouped simple-fade Lightbox navigation.
- Added replay controls throughout Text Motion and content entrance demos.

### Added

- `kineto.requirements.json` and expanded `OWNER_REQUIREMENTS.md` with 29 machine-tested owner requirements.
- Full categorized 32-module QA demo.
- Browser assertions for Counter/Loader classification, image effect convergence, MP3 mode semantics, replay controls, ripple cleanup, bounded glow, media UI, and zero-instance teardown.

### Fixed

- Pixelate could remove its Canvas before the browser had committed the final native-lazy image, leaving a blank result.
- Horizontal and floating Sticky Stack modes were incorrectly parsed as the default vertical mode.
- WAAPI `fill-forwards` prevented the hidden Rewind reset from returning to the start.
- Slider fallback slides overlapped because generated slides were positioned absolutely.
- Ambient Media glow could be hidden behind the page stacking context.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-07-17

### Stabilized

- Preserved all **30** modules. Previous documents said 29 while the actual source exported 30; no module was deleted to reconcile the mismatch.
- Rebuilt the core registry and lifecycle handling with duplicate initialization protection.
- Fixed direct `instance.destroy()` so it also removes the stale core record and permits clean recreation.
- Added consistent `create`, `pause`, `resume`, `replay`, and `destroy` behavior across modules.
- Repaired undefined runtime references including GSAP/ScrollTrigger helpers, text segmentation, interpolation, presets, and utility functions.
- Registered GSAP and ScrollTrigger in ESM environments instead of relying only on browser globals.
- Repaired Lenis integration and global visibility pause/resume.
- Reworked lazy media effects, including Canvas pixelate with CORS-safe fallback.
- Repaired Hangul composition frames and grapheme segmentation for text reveal effects.
- Repaired slider pointer, keyboard, autoplay, hover pause, accessibility state, and cleanup behavior.
- Repaired page transition content replacement, history handling, abortable fetch, re-scan, and teardown.
- Fixed timers/listeners/observers/RAF/GSAP cleanup across modules, including pageReveal timer cleanup.
- Restored compatibility methods used by the existing demo under `Kineto.core`.
- Preserved property descriptors while normalizing instances so live getters such as `slider.index` remain live.
- Restored original HTML, inline styles, and ARIA attributes for repaired modules, including reduced-motion fallbacks.
- Replaced the slot counter's fixed row height with computed typography-aware line height.
- Tore down Lenis and visibility services when the final instance is destroyed.
- Added regression checks for unknown-module no-op behavior, descendant destruction, replacement-option replay, and reduced-motion static rendering.

### Added

- `kineto.features.json`: machine-readable module/API contract covering modules, activation attributes, variants, public options, root properties, and core methods.
- `FEATURE_CONTRACT.md`: no-silent-feature-change rules.
- `AGENTS.md`: strict workflow for AI-assisted patches.
- React, Vue 3, and jQuery adapter entry points.
- ESM, browser UMD, CommonJS-compatible UMD copy, and stable CSS exports.
- ESLint, exact public-surface/option contract test, generated documentation check, Chromium lifecycle smoke test, package surface test, and `npm run verify`.

### Changed

- Correct package CSS import is now `kineto/style.css`.
- Browser bundle is `dist/kineto.umd.js`; CommonJS uses `dist/kineto.umd.cjs`.
- Primary documentation now describes tested behavior and known limitations instead of unverified performance or compatibility claims.
- Build tooling updated to Vite 8.1.5 and Playwright Core 1.61.1.

### Security
